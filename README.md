## 🤖 Agentic Development
**This project is heavily and primarily developed by AI agents.**  
From architecture and core logic to the Blazor frontend and DevOps pipelines, Mythril is a testament to agentic software engineering. All changes, including this documentation, are managed and validated by agents to ensure technical integrity and adherence to the project's [AI Mandates](GEMINI.md).
