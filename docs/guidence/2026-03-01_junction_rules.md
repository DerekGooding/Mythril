# Guidance Request: Junctioning Specifics & Cadence Sharing

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Agent:** Gemini CLI

## Context
Following the FF8/FFT inspiration, I am planning the implementation of the Junction UI and the scaling of magic bonuses. To ensure technical integrity, I need to clarify a few rules regarding resource management.

## Questions
1. **Magic Limits:** Does Magic have a fixed quantity limit per character (e.g., 100 of a single spell) or is it shared as a global inventory resource?
2. **Junction Scaling:** Should the stat bonus from junctioned magic be linear (e.g., +1 Str per 10 Fire) or use a diminishing returns formula?
3. **Cadence Exclusivity:** Can multiple characters equip the same Cadence simultaneously (like FFT Jobs), or is each Cadence a unique entity that can only be on one person at a time (like FF8 GFs)?
4. **Junction Overlap:** If a character switches Cadences, do they lose their Junctions, or should the "J-Str" knowledge persist if they unlocked it elsewhere?
