## [2026-03-01] Core Mechanics & Content Strategy (FF8/FFT Inspiration)

### **Vision**
The game is inspired by the **FF8 Junction System** and the **FF Tactics Job System**.
- **Cadences** function as both **Jobs** and **Guardian Forces (GFs)**.

### **The Core Game Loop**
1. **Unlock & Equip:** Unlock a Cadence and equip it to a character.
2. **Ability Progression:** Spend items to unlock new abilities within that Cadence.
3. **Refinement:** Use Cadence abilities to refine rewarded items into **Magic**.
4. **Junctioning:** Combine Magic with Cadence **Junction Abilities** to increase character stats.
5. **Scaling:** Higher stats allow characters to perform related quests faster or unlock higher-tier item quests.

### **Short-Term Priority**
- Do not focus on endgame yet.
- **Goal:** Implement a solid **20-30 minute onboarding experience** that teaches these mechanics (Equipping, Refining, Junctioning).
- Ensure the core mechanics (Items -> Magic -> Stats -> Efficiency) are fully functional and intuitive before scaling content.
