# Feedback: Easier way to submit feedback

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Type:** Feature Request
**Source:** Jeff

## Description
Currently we have to go to the CLI and run the command line to leave feedback. Is there some way to build the feedback submission right into the game browser itself? So that I can leave feedback as I'm playing. Thanks.

## Impact
Currently slow and awkward to use

## Proposed Solution (Optional)
Some kind of build in feedback window or form baked into the game itself.

## Status
