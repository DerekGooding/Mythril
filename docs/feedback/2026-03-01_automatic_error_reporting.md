## Description
Sometimes the browser has errors. It would be nice if the console errors were automatically logged somewhere so the developers see it and can work to fix the problem. So that I don't have to fill out a feedback report.

## Impact
Amazing! Would be so nice!

## Proposed Solution (Optional)
Oh please. We need to fix all the bugs.

## Status
- [ ] Investigated
- [ ] Implemented
