## Description
Every location task is completed in 3 seconds. This is great for testing but it's not very fun.

## Impact
boring

## Proposed Solution (Optional)
Can we toggle the "test" mode somehow. So testers can complete tasks in 3 seconds but there is a default meaningful amount of time to complete tasks otherwise?
