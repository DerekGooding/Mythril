# Tech Stack & Constraints
- MonoGame DesktopGL template in C#.
- Target .NET 9.
- Include GeonBit.UI (latest stable) via NuGet.
- The game must be cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Use default MonoGame Game1 structure unless explicitly replacing.
- Avoid any other game frameworks (Nez, FNA, Unity).
- Code must compile without external scripts or editors.
- Use consistent, clean naming and organize code into folders: Core/, UI/, GameLogic/.
