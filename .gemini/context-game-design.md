# Game Concept
Fantasy-themed incremental game.
- Core gameplay: player interacts with cards representing actions/resources.
- Players can drag and drop cards into zones to perform actions.
- Progress bars show ongoing tasks or production.
- Buttons trigger game events (collect, start task, etc.).
- No animations or 3D graphics at MVP.
- Game loop updates once per tick (200ms or adjustable).
- Future scalability: particle effects and visual polish possible later.

# MVP Goals
1. Functional drag-and-drop between card slots.
2. Clickable buttons triggering basic events.
3. Progress bars tied to simulated resource generation.
4. Simple fantasy skin: custom fonts, textures.
5. Layout that scales with window size.
