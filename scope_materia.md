# Materia System Scope

This document outlines the detailed scope of the Materia System, based on Final Fantasy VII.

## Materia Leveling

Materia levels up by gaining Ability Points (AP) from battles. When a Materia is equipped, it gains the full amount of AP awarded at the end of a battle. Once a Materia reaches its maximum level, it is considered "mastered." Mastered Materia often creates a new, level 1 copy of itself.

## Development Tips

*   **Materia Class Hierarchy:** Create a base `Materia` class with common properties like `Name`, `Description`, `AP`, and `Level`. Then, create subclasses for each type of Materia.
*   **Data-Driven Design:** Use data files (like JSON or XML) to define Materia properties, AP requirements, and abilities. This will make it easier to add new Materia and balance the game.
*   **AP Growth:** Implement a system for AP growth on weapons and armor (e.g., double or triple AP growth).
*   **Materia Spawning:** When a materia is mastered, it should spawn a new level 1 version of itself in the player's inventory.
