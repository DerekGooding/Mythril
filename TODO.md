## Tasks

- Log window, when closed needs to be able to be opened again if clicked, similar to the settings window.
- Drop zones need to always be drawn under drag and drop objects.
- Task progress needs to exist as a seperate window as not to squish other UI elements.
- Flash the Log button and Progress button if new information has been added since last opened. 
- Impliment visual representation of Characters in their respective UI element. 
- Fullscreen mode changes monitor resolution. This is not intended. Simply resize the game window to fill the existing space. Do not change resolution.

## Extended content work

- Review .gemini/ context files and plan additional work tasks.
